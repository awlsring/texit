# Texit

Texit is an api that allows for creating exit nodes in a cloud provider on demand for your tailnet.

Texit is designed to allow for launching exit nodes on various tailnets and cloud platforms. For Tailnets, both Tailscale and Headscale are supported. For providers, running nodes on ECS in an AWS Account is the only supported option.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide for information on how to get started with Texit.

You can find an example docker setup in the [example](example/api/docker) directory.
